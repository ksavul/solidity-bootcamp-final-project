If we need each page to have its own Route--
we have npm install react-router-dom

Create individual components for each page we want to display. For example, create a Game.tsx, BalancePage.tsx, and LandingPage.tsx.
Define your routes in a separate component, typically named AppRouter.tsx. Import your page components and set up routes like this:

// AppRouter.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route, BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import LandingPage from './LandingPage';
import GamePage from './GamePage';
import BalancePage from './BalancePage';

function AppRouter() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
        <Route path="/game" component={GamePage} />
        <Route path="/balance" component={BalancePage} />
        {/* Add more routes for additional pages */}
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
export default AppRouter;

In App.tsx, import and use the AppRouter component and when we navigate to different routes
 (e.g., /game, /balance) in app.tsx, React Router will automatically render the corresponding components.

 I was having issues with this approach but maybe you want to try if we need routes?
